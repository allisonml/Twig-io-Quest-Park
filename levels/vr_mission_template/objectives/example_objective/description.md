# How do we use lists?

<div class="aside">
<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It's good to keep high level tasks here.</li>
  <li>Let players know when to click <em>HACK</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

Give players a little bit of information about what they need to do to hack past this objective. If you find yourself writing more than a few short paragraphs of text, it's likely your objective is too big!

## What can you see?

Some times you wan to talk about additional concepts beyond the high level goal that might help players accomplish the high level goal.

```js
var thingsISee = __________________
```

## First thing's first

Describe the final values for your player one last time. Then ask them to click the _HACK_ button.
