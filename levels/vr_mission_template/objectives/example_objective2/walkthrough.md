Hint for Question 1: 
The first iteration starts with i = 0. The last time the continuation condition will be true is when i = 2 before the body executes.

Hint for Question 2:
Write out the value of count at the start of each loop.
If need be, you can look back at the steps of how the loop executes and think about when the condition is checked
 and incremented.
