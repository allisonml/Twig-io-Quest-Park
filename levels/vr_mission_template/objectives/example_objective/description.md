# How do we use lists?

<div class="aside">
<h3>To-Do List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Believe in yourself</li>
  <li>Make a list of 3 strings</li>
  <li>Think of how to retrieve an item from an array </li>
  <li>Enter both responses</li>
  <li>Click <em>HACK</em>.</li>
</ul>
</div>


## What can you see?

Isn't this a beautiful park? There's nothing like some greenery and a breath of fresh air to cheer you up.
Why don't we try making a list of 3 items (as strings) that you can see at the park?
Fill in the blank:

```js
var thingsISee = __________________;
```

## First thing's first
Now that I have my array of items that I see around me at the park, how can I use its elements?
I want to print out the first item on your list to my console. How would I fill in the blank:

```js
console.log(_________);
```
Hint: you'll probably need the index of the element

Your response to the first question should be an array of 3 items and your response to the second question should be a method that takes in an integer.
Then click the _HACK_ button.
