## A Friendly Game of Tag
Things to know:

You and some friends decided to play a game of tag. One of them's talking, but you're too far to hear.

```js
var secretMessage = ''
for(let count = 5; count >=; count--) {
    secretMessage = secretMessage + count + ", ";
}
secretMessage = secretMessage + "ready or not!";
```

- your first response should be an integer
- your second response should be a string, excluding the quotation  marks or apostrophes
